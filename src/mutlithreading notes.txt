mutlithreading notes

//by default all prorams that u create are going to run on one thread this means no multiprocessing
//you have to create a program that runs and should not block he ui
//by default everytime u run a new program a thread is created and u can do all the threading things
// you can make a thread sleep by  saying "Thread.sleep(put the time in ms)"put it in a try catch 
//can be new,ready,terminated,waiting

TWO WAYS OF CREATING A THREAD
//implementing an interface called runnable
//extending a class called thread
in both u have to override a mehod called run

true or false 
1)whenever u implement an interface u have to overide all the methods in that interface..False(some methods can be static)
-you have to overide all the abstract methods not just all the methods
2)whenever you extend a class you have to overide all non static methods in that class
false:::::only override the method whose behavior u want to change
3) when class demo extends a thread class demo becomes a thread
--true
4) is it possible to force a thread to run at an exact particular time
-no::: the operating system is the one that decides when a thread should run

// when u implement a thread create a thread object and create 
//create a runnable object, create a thread object using the thread class then start the run object

NOTE:: A runnable obeject is NOT  a thread
thread.join();
join makes the current thread wait for the thread on which u have called the join()
